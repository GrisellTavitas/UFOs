# UFOs
### Module 11 JavaScript

**1.-Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.**

Dana is a data journalist, and this time she has chose a topic that she had heard since she was a child; since she born in McMinnville, Oregon, which is famous for sightings and actually has an annual gallery of UFOs enthusiasts.

So, she decided to create an interactive webpage that allows readers to parse the data around UFO sightings, not only in McMinnville but all around US and some in Canada.

**2.-Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.**

The result of the interactive webpage it's exciting, the user can search data by these follow topics:

- ***BY DATE:***

**3.-Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.**

After this new design where we could see an easier way to make some filters even at the same time, we have some details to improve on those same filters; for example, one drawback would be the case sensitive, that would prevent a real search result, just by using capital letters. 

Since we have, two more headers on the table, we could add another filter for "Duration" search, and a query tool for looking a single word within the text of the "Comments".
